        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Actual application for the marriage license is made in person at the
          marriage license division of the countyâ€™s probate court at your local
          courthouse. Each applicant must bring two valid forms of
          identification. Both bride and groom must be 18 years old to apply
          without parental consent. You must fill out a brief form. The license
          is issued at the time of application, and there is no waiting period
          before the marriage can take place. Georgia residents may apply in any
          GA county. Non-GA residents must apply in the county where the
          marriage is to be performed.
